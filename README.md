# Zenodo Action

This is a quick helper action to allow you to automatically update a package on zenodo
on release, and without needing to enable admin webhooks. To get this working you will need to:

1. Create an account on Zenodo
2. Under your name -> Applications -> Developer Applications -> Personal Access Tokens -> +New Token and choose both scopes for deposit
3. Add the token to your repository secrets as `ZENODO_TOKEN`

**todo** under development!
